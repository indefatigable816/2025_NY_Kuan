Trastuzumab — Δ16: WT mean 0.4939 (n=17), Mutant mean 0.4911 (n=18), Δ = -0.0027 → Supports expected direction (very small)
Pertuzumab — S310F: WT mean 0.4482 (n=18), Mutant mean 0.5237 (n=15), Δ = +0.0755 → Contradicts expectation (higher iPTM)
Lapatinib — L755S: WT mean 0.6595 (n=20), Mutant mean 0.9613 (n=20), Δ = +0.3018 → Contradicts expectation (much higher iPTM)
Lapatinib — K753E: WT mean 0.6595 (n=20), Mutant mean 0.9634 (n=19), Δ = +0.3039 → Contradicts expectation (much higher iPTM)
Notes:

Primary metric: iptm (averaged from pair_chains_iptm if needed).
Quality filter: ptm > 0.5 applied.
Interpretation: Decreases in iPTM (Δ < 0) support the hypotheses; only Δ16 shows a tiny decrease (−0.0027). Other mutants show increased iPTM (contradict hypotheses). Remember iPTM is a structural-confidence metric, not direct binding affinity.
