Key Results
Hypothesis	Finding	Support
H1: Trastuzumab (Δ16)	ΔiPTM = -0.0524 (5.24% reduction)	✓✓ STRONG
H2: Pertuzumab (S310F)	ΔiPTM = +0.0093 (0.93% increase)	✗✗ NO SUPPORT
Conclusions
Trastuzumab/Δ16: AF3 iPTM trends STRONGLY SUPPORT the hypothesis that homodimerization impairs antibody binding (statistically significant, p < 0.000001)

Pertuzumab/S310F: AF3 iPTM trends CONTRADICT the hypothesis; S310F shows slightly higher interface confidence, not lower (p = 0.058)

Overall: Mixed validation. Only 1 of 2 mechanistic hypotheses supported by AF3 multimer confidence predictions.
